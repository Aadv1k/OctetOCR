# Octet

Octet is an OCR model training system, this includes functionality for both **preparing and training** the data.

Since this project is under development, things may change at anytime and I am planning things out as it goes.

## Build

Currently you can build an executable, I will switch this out for tests and such

```console
.\build.bat
```
